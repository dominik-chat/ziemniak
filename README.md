Ziemniak is an operating system written and maintained per-boredom basis.

The name means "potato" and perfectly sums up the intention of writing this project.
This system performs just as potato performs as food - poorly.
The project is not meant to replace any current operating systems, but it should be functional.

## Compilation

The program requires [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/), i686-elf and x86_64-elf versions of [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

The compilation itself can be performed by executing the following command int the root of the repository:
```
make
```
